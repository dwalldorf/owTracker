# owTracker - The CS:GO Overwatch tracker

A tool to persist your CS:GO overwatch cases and see statistics of interest.

# dev setup

## Requirements
You need to have vagrant installed. If you haven't, get it: [vagrantup.com](https://www.vagrantup.com/)

## Get it running
Check out the code base: `git checkout https://github.com/dwalldorf/owTracker.git`

Get vagrant running: (from inside the project directory)`vagrant up` and get a coffee.

Once vagrant has finished it's setup, connect to the vm and set up the project:

    vagrant ssh
    ./bin/build.sh

This will install all required composer and npm packages and prepare the frontend application. 
Now you can point your browser to [localhost:8080/app.php](http://localhost:8080/app.php) or [localhost:8080/app_dev.php](http://localhost:8080/app_dev.php).

If you fiddle around with styling, use the watchSass script to watch for changes and compile your scss to css: 

    vagrant ssh
    ./bin/watchSass
